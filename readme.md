This is a program made by Edvin.

Have you ever thought that games like blue archive and hatsune miku colourful stage have a cool cursor? This is an attempt to recreate those

to run this program just do "./build.sh&" this will build the program and run it, it doesnt take that long to compile because its a small program. if you dont wanna compile just do ./cursorEffects&.

use "pkill cursorEffects" to stop the program

Note this program only works in X11 and not xwayland because of waylands security that restricts some vital functions.
Note this program only works on window managers that have transparency
